          <h2><div class="title"><b></b>OUR STORY</b></div></h2>
          <p>The <span class="highlight">GRAND MINARVA </span>hotels is a family business founded by entrepreneurs. We have a history of over 50 years of hospitality experience, where we started with a small B&B and as the business grew, we kept true to our heritage. </p>
          <p>We have retained our agile nature. Every day is Day One. Never resting, always challenging ourselves to be better, yet staying true to who we are.</p>
          <p>We want to bring heartfelt hospitality to the economy hotel sector. We believe the essentials of travel speak to the heart and not just the head. A hotel should never just be a room. Price should never mean you feel like you’re just another number. We believe everyone, whenever they travel, should feel more than welcomed, they should feel like they belong</p>
          <p>Heartfelt, sincere hospitality has shaped our, past, present and future.</p>
          <p>It’s in our DNA.</p>
